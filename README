This package contains a Python implementation of the tiny version of the WavPack 
4.40 decoder. It is packaged with a demo command-line program that accepts a
WavPack audio file as input and outputs a RIFF wav file (with the filename 
output.wav). The program was developed using Python version 2.5.1

To run the demo program, use the following command

python WvDemo.py sample.wv

where sample.wv is the name of the WavPack file you wish to decode to a WAV file.
If you do not specify an input WavPack file it will look for a file called input.wv
The output WAV file will be named output.wav

This decoder will not handle "correction" files, plays only the first two 
channels of multi-channel files, and is limited in resolution in some large 
integer or floating point files (but always provides at least 24 bits of 
resolution). It also will not accept WavPack files from before version 4.0.
